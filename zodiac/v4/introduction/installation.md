# Installation
## Installation with Composer

You can install this package quickly and easily with Composer.

Require the package via Composer:

composer require intervention/zodiac
```

Although the library is **framework agnostic** it comes with a service provider for the [Laravel Framework](https://www.laravel.com/). Which will be discovered automatically and registers the calculator into your installation.

After the installation you can start [using the calculator](/v3/api/calculator).
