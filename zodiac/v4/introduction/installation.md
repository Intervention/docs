# Installation
## Installation with Composer

Install the package with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) by running the following command.

```bash
composer require intervention/zodiac
```

Although the library is **framework agnostic** it comes with a service provider
for the [Laravel Framework](https://www.laravel.com/). Which will be discovered
automatically and registers the calculator into your installation.

After the installation you can start [using the calculator](/v4/api/calculator).
