## Working with Zodiac Objects

[TOC]

The zodiac objects returned from the [calculator](/v3/api/calculator) can be used in the following ways.

### Zodiac Name

> public Zodiac::name(): string

Return the name of the current zodiac. This is more a identification key than a textual title. It's possible to cast the zodiac object to a string type to get the same result.

```php
use Intervention\Zodiac\Calculator;

// create from iso date
$zodiac = Calculator::make('1977-06-17');
$name = $zodiac->name(); // gemini
$name = (string) $zodiac; // get name by casting to string
```

### Localized Title

> public Zodiac::localized(?string $locale = null): string

Return the localized title of the current zodiac in the given locale. The locale parameter is optional, by default the english language is returned.

```php
use Intervention\Zodiac\Calculator;

// create from iso date
$zodiac = Calculator::make('1977-06-17');
$name = $zodiac->localized('fr'); // GÃ©meaux
```

### HTML Representation

> public Zodiac::html(): string

Returns the [HTML UTF-8 symbol code](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_symbols.asp) representing an icon of the current zodiac sign.

```php
use Intervention\Zodiac\Calculator;

// create from iso date
$zodiac = Calculator::make('1977-06-17');
$name = $zodiac->html(); // &#9802;
```
