### Return Values
Resized instance of `Intervention\Image\Image`

### Examples

```php
// resize image to new height
$img = Image::make('public/foo.jpg')->heighten(100);

// resize image to new height but do not exceed original size
$img = Image::make('public/foo.jpg')->heighten(100, function ($constraint) {
    $constraint->upsize();
});
```
