Image Filters in Intervention Image give you the useful possibility to group image transformations commands into a dedicated object. This object defines which command, in which order and with which arguments should be called on an image instance.

Intervention Image provides the basic ```Intervention\Image\Filters\FilterInterface```, which all filters need to implement.

Once you have created your own filters, you can apply them using the [filter()](/v2/api/filter) method.

#### Applying the demo filter

```php
// init new image instance
$img = Image::make('foo.jpg');

// apply filter
$img->filter(new DemoFilter(45));
```

Take a look at the example of the DemoFilter ```src/Intervention/Image/Filters/DemoFilter.php``` which combines a greyscale/pixelate effect.

#### DemoFilter Example

```php
<?php

namespace Intervention\Image\Filters;

class DemoFilter implements FilterInterface
{
    /**
     * Default size of filter effects
     */
    const DEFAULT_SIZE = 10;

    /**
     * Size of filter effects
     *
     * @var integer
     */
    private $size;

    /**
     * Creates new instance of filter
     *
     * @param integer $size
     */
    public function __construct($size = null)
    {
        $this->size = is_numeric($size) ? intval($size) : self::DEFAULT_SIZE;
    }

    /**
     * Applies filter effects to given image
     *
     * @param  Intervention\Image\Image $image
     * @return Intervention\Image\Image
     */
    public function applyFilter(\Intervention\Image\Image $image)
    {
        $image->pixelate($this->size);
        $image->greyscale();

        return $image;
    }
}
```
