PHP lets people upload files and with Intervention Image you can easily pass an uploaded image to the [make()](/v2/api/make) method. The standard way is to get the temp. file information from the ```$_FILES``` array.

Read more about file uploads in the official [PHP documentation](http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php).

#### Creating Image from File Upload

// read image from temporary file
$img = Image::make($_FILES['image']['tmp_name']);

$img->fit(300, 200);

```
