# Installation
## Installation with Composer

You can install this package quick and easy with Composer.

Require the package via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require intervention/validation
```

The Validation library is built to work with the Laravel Framework (>=10). It
comes with a service provider, which will be discovered automatically and
registers the validation rules into your installation.
