# Intervention Validation
## Missing Laravel Validation Rules

Intervention Validation is an extension library for Laravel's own validation
system. The package adds over 30 additional validation rules to verify data
like IBAN, BIC, ISBN, creditcard numbers and more.

- All rules implement the `Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\ValidationRule` interface
- Use the additional rules in combination with Laravel's own rules
