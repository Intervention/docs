Intervention Validation is an extension library for Laravel's own validation system. The package adds over 30 additional validation rules to verify data like IBAN, BIC, ISBN, creditcard numbers and more.

- All rules implement the `Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Rule` interface
- Use the additional rules in combination with Laravel's own rules
